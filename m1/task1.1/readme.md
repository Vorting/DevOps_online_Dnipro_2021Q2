1. I install GIT on my machine.
2. I configured git and generated SSH-key for future  push/pull requests without any authorizations.
3. I haven't created an account because I already got it.
4. Clone repo to my workstation.
5. I did all steps and operations such as creating branches, "images", "styles", "develop" in bash.
6. I read about "git reflog" and I created file task1.1_GIT.txt then I added it to repo.
7. I made file readme.md and I described about my results in this file.    




In my opinion, DevOps is an employee who can work
between two structures: development and operations.
